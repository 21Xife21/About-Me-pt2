    Hi my name is William Tarnovsky, The program I am in is Graphics Design. I've been doing Graphics Design since I was 15 so for around 2 years now (Yes, I'm 17)
        I've always been lost in what I wanted to do in my future but I've never really realised what I did as a child which mainly skecting and drawing. I'm not the best at drawing but I used to
        spend a lot of time on my computer and I figured huh why don't I put my creative side and my love for building computers together and so here I am. I've also been a big fan an clothes Designing
        and usually when people hear me say that they think oh like Shirts, pants, and jackets well yes I'd make to make designs for those but I also enjoy making dresses and suits as well as shoes.
        When it comes to prefreance whether I like Windows or Mac I have mixed opinions since people tell me that Mac is better for Graphics Design but I've been doing up pretty well so far with Windows
        I'd say I like using Windows more since I've been using it all my life so to me it seems simplar to use and I also enjoy playing games and windows is better for that.

    well here's a little bit about myself. I enjoy going outside I would say I'm a night owl but it also depends on who I'm with and what I am doing. I like playing video games such as GTA5, League of legends,
     Valorant, Apex Legends, Call Of Duty, OverWatch, Minecraft, Terraria, and A lot more but since school has started up again I haven't really had the time to play games. I also have a girlfriend so that leaves me with even less time to play games but wait there is more. I also go to the gym and I have a job so my life 
    is pretty compacked. I would say my favoruit activity right now would be sleeping since I don't really have time to do anything else. Some other things about me is that I have two cats the females name is Gingi and the males name is sky
    both very cute cats. I don't really know what else people would like to know about me, all I really know is that the more time you spend with me the more you'll get to know me because there is definitely a lot of stuff I am missing here that I can't 
quite remember at the moment
